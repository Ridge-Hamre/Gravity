<p>The original work submitted for assignment 3 was a Haiku about who Ridge is and what a person might expect from encountering Ridge. It truely is a masterpiece in the genre of horror haiku's.</p>

<p>In order to convert the text into multiple formats so that more people could be exposed to magnificence I had to create a script that upon execution would convert the original into 5 different file formats.</p>

<p>Follow the link to check out the Haiku: <a href="https://github.com/Ridge-Hamre/convert-documents/blob/master/haiku.md">Haiku.md</a></p>
